# If you have a mod with additional liberty desire effects that you want to be compatible with this mod, simply:
# Choose one of the values below, put it in your own file with a file name that begins later than M alphabetically.
# Put everything you want inside this mod value in your file, and use the description localization to label it whatever you want.
# Any other sub-points, breakdowns, and the details of these localizations all live entirely in your mod.
# As long as you use the value name (compatible_mod_value_x) and the associated description names at the top level, you will be able to make it compatible with this.
