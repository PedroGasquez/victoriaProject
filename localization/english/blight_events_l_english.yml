blight.3.t: "Potato Blight Returns"
blight.3.d: "The Blight has returned, this time destroying vast swathes of the potato harvest.

Ireland and the Scottish Highlands have been especially devastated, with upwards of 80% of the crop being rendered inedible."
blight.3.f: ""On this very day a cry of Famine, wilder and more fearful than ever, is rising from every parish and county in the land. Where the new crop ought to be, there is a loathsome mass of putrefaction: the sole food on which millions of men, women and children are to be fed is stricken by a deadly blight before their eyes; and probably within one month those millions will be hungry and have nothing to eat.

blight.5.f: ""Into every seaport in Ireland are now thronging thousands of farmers, with their families, who have chosen to leave their lands untilled and undown, to sell horses and stock and turn all into money to go to America, carrying off both the money and the industry that created it, and leaving a more helpless mass of misery and despair behind them."" #The Nation

blight.6.f: ""Ireland must in return behold her best flour, her wheat, her bacon, her butter, her live cattle, all going to England day after day. She dare not ask the cause of this fatal discrepancy – the existence of famine in a country, whose staple commodity is food – food – food of the best – and of the most exquisite quality."" #The Chronicle and Munster Advertiser

Even the Choctaw Nation in America has sent a small sum to aid the [SCOPE.sCulture('irish_scope').GetName] people."
blight.7.f: ""Her Majesty the Queen immediately directed that her name should be placed at the head of a list of donors for a contribution of £2,000, with a most gracious promise of such further amount as the exigency might demand."" #British Association for the Relief of the Extreme Distress in Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland

blight.8.t: "Taking the Soup"
blight.8.d: "Christian organizations of all denominations have set up soup kitchens across Ireland to give what food they can to the starving populace. A few ardent Anglican charities have refused to give aid to any [SCOPE.sReligion('catholic_scope').GetName] that does not forsake the Pope. While most soup kitchens give freely, stories of "soupers" trading their souls for food have spread across the island. Some have chosen to starve rather than accept soup from any [SCOPE.sReligion('protestant_scope').GetName] effort."
blight.8.f: ""That soup might fill you up, but at what cost? Your souls will be chained up for all eternity! Many have been taken by the fever and the hunger, but they are with the Lord now. Take that soup and you will go to Hell, and be damned forever!"" #Black 47
