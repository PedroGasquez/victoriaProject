stts_movement.3.d: "Differences between the [SCOPE.sPoliticalMovement('socialist_movement_1').GetName] and the [SCOPE.sPoliticalMovement('socialist_movement_2').GetName] have erupted into heated disagreements over which is the correct path for the workers' cause. Collaboration between the two sides has collapsed, with each group now attempting to poach support from the other."
stts_movement.3.f: ""They are splitters! Lifestylists! Agents of dissolution!

United by a common foe, left-wing and liberal activists are coalescing around the larger movements as the most effective counter-force against the right."
stts_movement.4.f: ""The workers' class enemy quickly sensed and understood what a tremendous danger the People's Front, the unity of all anti-fascist forces, constitutes for him. As long as the proletariat is disunited, as long as it has not established proper relationships and collaboration with the other democratic forces in the country, it is not so difficult, for the handful of financial and industrial magnates, for the fascist bourgeoisie, to crush the working class movement, to defeat the various strata of the people one by one, and destroy democracy. The fascists have successfully applied the well-known crafty motto -- "divide and rule.""" #Georgi Dimitrov The People's Front

stts_movement.6.f: ""You have been sent to lead the people to happiness; but happiness is snatched from us by the officials, who leave us only sorrow and humiliation. Consider our demands attentively and without anger. They have been uttered not for evil, but for good; for our good, Sire, and yours. It is not insolence that speaks in us, but the consciousness of the general necessity of escaping from the present intolerable state of things."" #The St. Petersburg workmen's petition to the Tsar

Many persons were killed or injured and windows and doors were shattered over a large area.\n\nThe bags containing the money disappeared and no trace of them has been found.

stts_movement.10.t: "Leaderless Resistance"
stts_movement.10.d: "The [GetLawType('law_secret_police').GetName] is having considerable difficulty suppressing the [SCOPE.sPoliticalMovement('anarchist_movement').GetName]. The movement's decentralized structure and ideological character have flummoxed most traditional infiltration methods."
stts_movement.10.f: ""Report: Infiltration of the anarchists is made difficult by the communal nature of their  lifestyle (under constant observation and scrutiny) and the extensive knowledge held by many anarchists, which require a considerable amount of study and time for any prospective agent to acquire.
